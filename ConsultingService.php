         what robots are. We imagine transformer robots or AI's with full human like features. In reality Autonomous Things surround
         everyday life, for example Amazon's Alexa or an off-brand drone one can buy in Smith Toy Stores. Autonomous things is the 
         official term for the technological developments that are expected to bring computers into the physical environment as autonomous 
         entities without human direction, freely moving and interacting with humans and other objects
